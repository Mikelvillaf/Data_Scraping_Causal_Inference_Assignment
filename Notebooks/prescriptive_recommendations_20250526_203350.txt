## Strategic Roadmap for E-commerce Solar Cream Products on MercadoLibre

### 1. Recommendations for SELLERS

#### Immediate (0-3 months)

**Action: Adjust Discount Strategies**
- **Recommendation**: Avoid high discounts (>15%) especially for unverified sellers. Instead, focus on smaller, strategic discounts (5-10%).
- **Causal Reasoning**: High discounts negatively impact ratings, particularly from unverified sellers, as they signal lower trust and quality.
- **Estimated Impact**: A potential increase in product ratings by 0.1 points, improving perceived quality.
- **Risks**: Lower sales volume initially; potential for losing competitive edge against low-price competitors.
- **Mitigation**: Monitor competitor pricing closely and adjust accordingly, emphasizing value rather than discount.

#### Medium-Term (3-12 months)

**Action: Build Trust and Credibility**
- **Recommendation**: Invest in seller verification and customer service improvements; highlight verified status visibly on product listings.
- **Causal Reasoning**: The negative discount effect is mitigated for verified sellers, suggesting that trust enhances customer perception.
- **Estimated Impact**: Improved ratings and potentially higher conversion rates from increased trust.
- **Risks**: Costs associated with verification and customer service upgrades.
- **Mitigation**: Develop a phased plan to improve verification and service without overwhelming operational capacity.

#### Long-Term (12+ months)

**Action: Quality Signaling through Product Presentation**
- **Recommendation**: Use high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and customer testimonials prominently in listings.
- **Causal Reasoning**: Quality signals can counteract the negative perceptions associated with discounts, especially in mid-range products (Q3).
- **Estimated Impact**: Enhanced product attractiveness may lead to increased sales and improved ratings.
- **Risks**: Potentially higher costs for quality content creation.
- **Mitigation**: Utilize customer-generated content (e.g., reviews, images) to reduce costs.

- **Estimated Impact**: Improved ratings across the marketplace, fostering a better shopping experience.
- **Risks**: Seller pushback; potential loss of price-sensitive customers.
- **Mitigation**: Communicate the rationale clearly to sellers; provide data showing the long-term benefits.

#### Medium-Term (3-12 months)

**Action: Enhance Seller Verification System**
- **Recommendation**: Streamline the seller verification process and introduce tiered verification levels that reward performance.
- **Causal Reasoning**: Verified sellers experience less negative impact from discounting, indicating that trust is crucial for customer satisfaction.
- **Estimated Impact**: Higher seller retention and customer satisfaction, leading to increased sales across the platform.
- **Risks**: Implementation complexities and costs.
- **Mitigation**: Pilot the new system with a small group of sellers first.

#### Long-Term (12+ months)

**Action: Algorithm Adjustments for Search/Ranking**
- **Recommendation**: Incorporate product ratings and seller verification status more prominently in search rankings.
- **Causal Reasoning**: By prioritizing higher-rated and verified products, the platform can promote trust and quality.
